## Hurghada Grand Aquarium Mock Landing Page
The Hurghada Grand Aquarium is one of the attractive places in Hurghada, Egypt that that has attracted many families over years and still making people have fun.<br> This webpage is an imaginary, super-simple, landing page for the place.

## Why:
* The purpose of making this webpage was introducing myself to basic characteristics of HTML, CSS, Raw JavaScript, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

### JavaScript and The DOM:
The DOM is leveraged using JavaScript:
* To make the webpage changes its appearance according to how the user moves in it.
* To automatically build parts of the webpage depending on other main parts already existing -dynamically generating web elements- (e.g. the navigation bar at the top is automatically generated using the page sections already existing)
