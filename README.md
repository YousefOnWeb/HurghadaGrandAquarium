# Hurghada Grand Aquarium Imaginary Landing Page

## Introduction:

##### The Hurghada Grand Aquarium is one of the attractive places in Hurghada, Egypt that that has attracted many families over years and still making people have fun.<br> This webpage is an imaginary, super-simple, landing page for the place.

## Why:
* The purpose of making this webpage is introducing myself to basic characteristics of HTML, CSS, Raw JavaScript, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

## How does making this page introduce me to the mentioned above:
### HTML:
* To from the 'skeleton' of the page (i.e. specify the main design elements and their basic layout).
### CSS:
* To give those elements their style
### JavaScript and The Dom:
The DOM is leveraged using JavaScript:
* To make the webpage changes its appearance according to how the user moves in it.
* To automatically build parts of the webpage depending on other main parts already existing -dynamically generating web elements- (e.g. the navigation bar at the top is automatically generated using the page sections already existing)
